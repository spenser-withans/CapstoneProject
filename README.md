# CapstoneProject
This project is on predicting/estimating housing prices in Pinellas County, FL based on previous sales data, key features such as location, style of residence, size, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, and on indirect feature such as school performance, crime statistics, and evacuation zone info.

Housing data is from a dolthub dataset that I narrowed down to Pinellas County, but I might be able to collect it from the county property appraiser directly.

I am trying to create a capstone project repository that is linked to a google drive folder.
